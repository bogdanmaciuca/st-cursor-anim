# st-cursor-anim
Simple Terminal with Neovide-like cursor animations.

This is a fork of [git://git.suckless.org/st](). It is my attempt at implementing Neovide-like cursor animations in a terminal.

## Support
For the time being i am pretty invested in this project and am willing to bring it to a usable and stable level. Will probably solve issues in a timely manner if my schedule allows me to do so.

## TODO:
- [ ] optimize rendering (have it be on demand)
